# AI Resume Tailor

AI Resume Tailor rewrites any resume so it mirrors a target job description. Paste a posting and your
resume and instantly receive a keyword-optimised version that matches the role&apos;s tone, skills, and
requirements.

## Features

- 🔁 **AI resume rewriting** – Uses OpenAI to restructure and rewrite resumes in an ATS-friendly
  format with Summary, Experience, Skills, and Education sections.
- 🆓 **Freemium tier** – Every account can tailor two resumes for free. Resume usage is stored per
  user and resets only when you upgrade.
- 🚀 **Pro upgrade** – Stripe Checkout powers the upgrade flow for unlimited tailoring. Successful
  payments automatically flag your account as Pro.
- 📜 **History log** – The last 10 tailored resumes are stored securely for quick access and export.
- 🔐 **Secure sessions** – Email/password auth backed by iron-session and Prisma keeps accounts
  private.
- 🛡️ **Security features** – Rate limiting, CSRF protection, input sanitization, and security headers.
- 📊 **Performance optimizations** – Caching, critical CSS, and optimized loading.
- ♿ **Accessibility** – ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.
- 📈 **Monitoring** – Error tracking with Sentry and structured logging.
- 🧪 **Testing** – Comprehensive unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library.

## Getting started

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the automated setup script
npm run setup

# Add your OpenAI API key to .env.local
# Then start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Manual Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLite database URL used by Prisma. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | API key for OpenAI. |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | (Optional) Override the OpenAI model. Defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`. |
| `SESSION_PASSWORD` | 32+ char secret for signing user sessions. |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe secret key used to create checkout sessions. |
| `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` | Price ID for the recurring Pro subscription. |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Secret from your Stripe webhook endpoint. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Public URL for redirecting to success/cancel pages. |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | (Optional) Sentry DSN for error monitoring. |

### 3. Initialise the database

Prisma requires a generated client and schema migrations. In environments without outbound network
access you may need to set `PRISMA_ENGINES_CHECKSUM_IGNORE_MISSING=1` when running the commands.

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

For local development you can also use:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### 4. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit <http://localhost:3000>.

### 5. Configure Stripe webhook

Create a webhook endpoint in Stripe that points to `/api/stripe/webhook` and listen to the following
events:

- `checkout.session.completed`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`

Use the provided signing secret as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## Development

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode

### Database management

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npm run prisma:generate

npm run prisma:deploy
```
